# Welcome to Deep Learning at Holberton School

Here you will find projects related to deep learning as I continue my journey as a student. Below is a list of the projects that will be updated as more projects are completed.

## Projects

1. **Neural Style:** A project that uses a neural algorithm of artistic styles, which combines the style of one image with the contents of another image. Installed torch7 and loadcaffe on Ubuntu 14.04. You can also create these masterpieces by checking them out [here!](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style/blob/master/README.md)
